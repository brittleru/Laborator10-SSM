# Laborator10-SSM
This is the tenth laboratory at Software for Mechatronics Systems, coordinated by Conf. Dr. Ing. Ciprian Ion Rizescu.

#### Brief
It is desired to implement a graphical interface containing:
 - Logo of the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Mechatronics
 - The logo of the University “Politehnica” of Bucharest
 - A button to calculate the volume, mass and the moment of inertia for the figure below
 - A dropdown button to be able to select which part of the part you want to calculate, in our case you want to calculate the shaft, the disc but also the whole assembly
 - All the inputs needed to perform the calculation
 - The results of the calculation
 - A button to be able to reset the entered values
 - A button to exit the application.
